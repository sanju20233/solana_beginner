#Project for Module 2 - Deploy a Hello World Program

## what we want to do 
### step1
Create a front end with a small button titled “Create a new Solana account” that generates a new KeyPair at the backend and airdrops 2 SOL to the newly created Keypair.
### step2
create another button that says - “Connect to Phantom Wallet”, which should connect to the Phantom Wallet if it exists, else point to a link where the user can install the extension.
### step3
Once this step is completed, add a button called “Transfer to new wallet”. This button should trigger a transfer of 2 SOL (airdropped into the account you generated in step 1) to the account connected in Step 2.
